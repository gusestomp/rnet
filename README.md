An ergonomic and modular Python HTTP client for advanced and low-level emulation, featuring customizable TLS, JA3/JA4, and HTTP/2 fingerprinting capabilities, powered by [wreq](https://github.com/0x676e67/wreq).

## Features

- Async and Blocking `Client`s
- Plain bodies, JSON, urlencoded, multipart
- HTTP Trailer
- Cookie Store
- Redirect Policy
- Original Header
- Rotating Proxies
- Connection Pooling
- Streaming Transfers
- Zero-Copy Transfers
- WebSocket Upgrade
- HTTPS via BoringSSL
- Free-Threaded Safety
- Automatic Decompression
- Certificate Store (CAs & mTLS)

## Example

The following example uses the `asyncio` runtime with `wreq` installed via pip:

```bash
pip install wreq
```

And then the code:

```python
import asyncio
from wreq import Client, Emulation


async def main():
    # Build a client
    client = Client(emulation=Emulation.Firefox149)

    # Use the API you're already familiar with
    resp = await client.get("https://tls.peet.ws/api/all")
    print(await resp.text())


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```

## Behavior

1. **HTTP/2 over TLS**

Due to the complexity of TLS encryption and the widespread adoption of HTTP/2, browser fingerprints such as **JA3**, **JA4**, and **Akamai** cannot be reliably emulated using simple fingerprint strings. Instead of parsing and emulating these string-based fingerprints, `wreq-python` provides fine-grained control over TLS and HTTP/2 extensions and settings for precise browser behavior emulation.

2. **Device Emulation**

**TLS** and **HTTP/2** fingerprints are often identical across various browser models because these underlying protocols evolve slower than browser release cycles. **100+ browser device emulation profiles** are maintained in **wreq-python**.

## Building

1. Platforms

- Linux(**glibc**/**musl**): `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `armv7`, `i686`
- macOS: `x86_64`,`aarch64`
- Windows: `x86_64`,`i686`,`aarch64`
- Android: `aarch64`, `x86_64`

2. Development

Install the BoringSSL build environment by referring to [boringssl](https://github.com/google/boringssl/blob/main/BUILDING.md).

```bash
# on ubuntu or debian
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake perl pkg-config libclang-dev musl-tools git
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
pip install uv maturin

uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# development
maturin develop --uv

# build wheels
maturin build --release
```

## Benchmark

Outperforms `requests`, `httpx`, `aiohttp`, and `curl_cffi`, and you can see the [benchmark](https://github.com/0x676e67/wreq-python/tree/main/bench) for details. The benchmark suite is driven by [pyperf](https://github.com/psf/pyperf), and results are still for reference only because network and system conditions affect outcomes.
